* 01/25
  * Problem Solving
    * 3 Stages
      1. Understand the problem
      2. Plan
      3. Pseudocode
  * Divide and Conquer approach
    - decompose problems into smaller subproblems

* 02/06
  * Understanding Errors
    * Common errors
      1. Syntax - grammatical rules (usually)
      2. Reference - variable (usually)
      3. Type - incompatible data types (operations, violation of properties, etc.)
    * Resolving errors
      * Research (StackOverflow, MDN)
      * console.log
      * Browser debugger
    * Error vs Warning
      * _Error_ disrupts code's runtime,
        * _Warning_ does not
      * _Error_ is usually red,
        * _Warning_ is in yellow
      * _Errors_ are problems to be resolved ASAP,
        * _Warnings_ are only __potential__ problems
